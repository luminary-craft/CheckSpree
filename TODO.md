### Updates
- Improve manual backup process to require a user generated password to open the file, ensure best practice for data security. Ensure it is able to be opened on another computer if encrypted with password protection.
- Ensure imports, batch processes and import queue respect the ledger that may be assigned to by the users import document. They may have differentiated which ledger the fee should be taken from and we need to ensure when batch processing happens it pulls from those ledgers. When those ledgers don't exist, a new one is generated with the name of the ledger from the import document starting at a 0 balance.
- Provide a downloadable csv file template for the user to be able to utilize for data management outside of the application. This is so if they prefer working in excel, they can have this sheet properly formatted for when they bring it into CheckSpree.
- Update Ledger to ux/ui. Clicking the Current Balance ammount should open an updated history modal that allows the admin (or user allowed to edit ledger) to edit the balance, add income entry, remove entries (which restore to the ledger balance when done), and transfer funds to other ledgers. Ensure the history modal is able to be sorted by date, amount, and check number. Ensure the current ledger functionality remains in place where only the check history of that ledger is displayed, and if the "All History" button is pressed at the top it is the same kind of modal but it shows the history of all ledgers. Ensure the history modal is able to be sorted by date, amount, and check number.
- Additional UI updates for the selection and editing of the ledgers, it is currently a little clunky, needing to press the 3 dots to open the available ledgers, and clicking the ledger to rename it, with a trashcan that is not themed correctly to delete the ledger. Lets make it so that there is a dropdown of the ledgers and when in admin mode when the ledgers are listed, the user can click the ledger to display it, or click a pencil icon to rename, or click the tashcan icon to delete it. The Initial Account Balance functionality can remain, but tweak the field to have proper currency formatting. Also, only admin should be able to make new ledgers, rename ledgers, and delete ledgers, but if the admin clicks the checkbox "All Standard Users to Edit Balance" they should be able to make new, rename, and delete ledgers. Lets also turn that into a toggle to match our other theme. The only time a new ledger is able to be made when admin mode isn't active and the "Allow standard users to edit balance" isn't checked is under the special condition that an entry comes via an import that has aledger that does not exist. That is when a modal appears saying the ledger doesn't exist and the user decides if it should generate a new 0 balance ledger with that name, or use a different ledger.
- [x] Edit Layout mode: Allow for drag and select of multiple fields to move them in a group.
